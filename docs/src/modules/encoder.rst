Encoders
========

The module ``encoder`` is used used to measure position by counting the pulses generated by a 
quadrature encoder. It is meant as a drop-in replacement for the `LinuxCNC encoder component <https://linuxcnc.org/docs/html/man/man9/encoder.9.html>`_ ,
with some extra functions.  Differences are:

* LitexCNC uses a different algorithm to calculate the velocity of the encoder. Therefore
  the HAL-pin ``min-speed-estimate`` is no longer used.
* To be able to simulate a (digital) potentiometer, the HAL-parameter ``position-scale`` is
  supplemented with ``position-offset``.
* The encoder can be configured to:
  
  * Have a custom reset-value (default=0)
  * Have a minimum and/or maximum value (default=None, meaning no minimum and/or maximum value). This
    functionality is required to create a (digital) potentiometer. 


Configuration
=============

The code-block belows gives an example for the configuration of ``stepgen`` for different
both a simple encoder and encoders with an index pulse.

Defining the pin is required in the configuration. Optionally one can give the pin a name which
will be used as an alias in HAL. When no name is given, no entry in the file containnig the
aliases will be generated.


.. tip::
  When *inserting* new pins in the list and the firmware is re-compiled, this will lead to a renumbering
  of the HAL-pins. When using numbers, it is therefore **strongly** recommended only to append instances to 
  prevent a complete overhaul of the HAL.

HAL
===

.. note::
    The input and output pins are seen from the module. I.e. the GPIO In module will take an
    value from the machine and will put this on its respective _output_ pins. While the GPIO
    Out module will read the value from it input pins and put the value on the physical pins.
    This might feel counter intuitive at first glance.

Input pins
----------
<board-name>.encoder.<n>.index-enable (HAL_BIT)
    When ``true``, counts and position are reset to zero on the next rising edge of
    Phase-Z. At the same time, index-enable is reset to zero to indicate that a rising 
    edge has occurred.

Output pins
-----------
<board-name>.encoder.<n>.counts (HAL_INT)
    Position in encoder counts.
<board-name>.encoder.<n>.index-pulse (HAL_BIT)
    When ``true``, a rising edge has been detected on the FPGA. This flag will be active
    until the next read action from the FPGA, when it is automatically reset.
<board-name>.encoder.<n>.position (HAL_FLOAT)
    Position in scaled units (see parameter position-scale).
<board-name>.encoder.<n>.velocity (HAL_FLOAT)
    Velocity in scaled units per second. Encoder uses an algorithm that greatly reduces
    quantization noise as compared to simply differentiating the position output. When 
    the magnitude of the true velocity is below min-speed-estimate, the velocity output 
    is 0.
<board-name>.encoder.<n>.velocity-rpm (HAL_FLOAT)
    Velocity in scaled units per minute. Simply encoder.N.velocity scaled by a factor 
    of 60 for convenience.
<board-name>.encoder.<n>.overflow-occurred (HAL_BIT)
    Indication that overflow has occurred. This indicates that the position and velocity
    might be less accurate due to rounding errors with floating point.

Parameters
----------
<board-name>.encoder.<n>.position-scale (HAL_FLOAT)
    Scale factor, in counts per (length) unit. For example, if position-scale is 500, 
    then 1000 counts of the encoder will be reported as a position of 2.0 units.
<board-name>.encoder.<n>.position-offset (HAL_FLOAT)
    Position offset in scaled units. When the encoder count is 0, this will be the
    reported position. Can be used to create a digital potentiometer.

Example
-------

The examples below uses the ``5a-75b_v#.#_i12o14p6s6e6.json`` firmware (except for the digital potentiometer,
which requires additional settings as shown in the example configuration above). Please change ``#.#`` for
the correct version of your board.

Break-out boards
================

For simple encoders, such as inputs for speed and feed overrides, the 
`12 channel sinking input <https://github.com/Peter-van-Tol/HUB-75-boards/tree/main/HUB75-Sinking_input>`_
can be used. This gives the possibility to combine GPIO input and encoders on a single break-out
board. The speed of this break-out board is limited by the maximum speed of the used opto-couplers.

For faster encoders a dedicated `fast encoder <.>`_
is created. This board support up to 3 A/B encoders or 2 A/B/Z encoders. This board is
developed to be used with differential output from the encoders.
