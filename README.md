# Welcome to LiteX-CNC!

This project aims to make a generic CNC firmware and driver for FPGA cards which are supported by LiteX. Configuration of the board and driver is done using json-files.

The idea of this project was conceived by ColorCNC by *romanetz* on the official LinuxCNC and the difficulty to obtain a MESA card.

> **Experimental** <br>
> At this moment this code is experimental and requires expansion. A test card has been received and a test setup has been created with an Raspberry Pi. The modules GPIO and PWM are tested and are working. Expansion of the project with stepgen, encoders, watchdog, etc. is now required.

## Acknowledgements
This project would not be possible without:
- ColorCNC by *romanetz* [link](https://forum.linuxcnc.org/27-driver-boards/44422-colorcnc?start=0);
- HostMot2 (MESA card driver) as the structure of the driver has been adopted.

## Drivers

### Installation
The installation of the driver is independent from the configuration. In order to install the driver, a modified version of `halcompile` is created. The script `halcompile` is a Python-script which creates and executes the required MakeFiles. Because the driver required [json-c](https://github.com/json-c/json-c), an extra flag had to be added.

This guide is written for a default installation of linuxcnc-2.8.2-buster. The steps may differ for other distributions.

Firstly install the needed packages to compile the driver:
```bash
sudo apt-get install libjson-c-dev
sudo apt-get install git
sudo apt-get install build-essential
```

Next, clone the repository with the source code:
```bash
git clone github.com/Peter-van-Tol/LiteX-CNC.git
cd LiteX-CNC
```

Then, locate halcompile, and replace it with the one from this repository:
```
# whereis halcompile
halcompile: /usr/bin/halcompile /usr/share/man/man1/halcompile.1.gz
sudo cp halcompile.py /usr/bin/halcompile
```

> **NOTE**: When the file `halcompile` cannot be found, make sure you have `linuxcnc-dev` installed, i.e. `sudo apt-get install linuxcnc-dev`.

Now, the LiteX-CNC can be build and installed using `halcompile`:
```bash
cd driver
sudo halcompile --install litexcnc.c litexcnc_eth.c litexcnc_debug.c 
```

### Usage
First start halrun, then load the litecnc driver:
```bash
halrun
halcmd: loadrt litexcnc
Note: Using POSIX realtime
litexcnc: Loading Litex CNC driver version 1.0.0
halcmd: 
```

After loading the main driver, the board-driver can be loaded. At this moment only ethernet cards are supported using the `litexcnc_eth` board-driver. All the board-driver modules accept a load-time modparam of type string array, named `config_file`. This array has one config_file string for each board the driver should use. Each json-file is passed to and parsed by the litexcnc driver when the board-driver registers the board. The paths can contain spaces, so it is usually a good idea to wrap the whole thing in double-quotes (the " character). The comma character (,) separates members of the config array from each other.
```
halcmd: loadrt litexcnc_eth config_file="/workspace/examples/5a-75e.json"
```

### Functions

The table below gives the functions exported by LiteX-CNC. 

| Function        | Description |
|-----------------|-------------|
| litexcnc_<BoardName>.<BoardNum>.read | This reads the encoder counters, stepgen feedbacks, and GPIO input pins from the FPGA. |
| litexcnc_<BoardName>.<BoardNum>.write     | This updates the PWM duty cycles, stepgen rates, and GPIO outputs on the FPGA. Any changes to configuration pins such as stepgen timing, GPIO inversions, etc, are also effected by this function. |

Example:
```
loadrt threads name1=servo-thread period1=1000000
addf test.0.write servo-thread
addf test.0.read servo-thread
```

### Pins and parameters

#### GPIO

> By default, the name of the pin is as defined in the JSON and uses the LiteX name of the pin (for example `j13:6`, meaning connector 13, pin 6). When in the in the josn-configutation the field `alias` is set, this name will be used instead.

| Pin        | Type | Description |
|------------|------|-------------|
|litexcnc_<BoardName>.<BoardNum>.<PinName>.in | (bit out) | State of the hardware input pin.
|litexcnc_<BoardName>.<BoardNum>.<PinName>.in_not | (bit out) | Inverted state of the hardware input pin.
|litexcnc_<BoardName>.<BoardNum>.<PinName>.out | (bit in) | Value to be written (possibly inverted) to the hardware output pin.

| Parameter  | Type | Description |
|------------|------|-------------|
|litexcnc_<BoardName>.<BoardNum>.<PinName>.invert_output | (bit in) | If this parameter is true, the output value of the GPIO will be the inverse of the value on the "out" HAL pin.

## Supported boards
All boards which support [LiteEth](https://github.com/enjoy-digital/liteeth) are supported, this includes the re-purposed Colorlight 5a-75a, 5a-75e, i5 and i9 boards. A full list of boards supported by LiteX and whether LiteEth is supported can be found [here](https://github.com/litex-hub/litex-boards).

The structure of the driver allows to add more communication protocols in the future. I'm looking forward to add USB support as well. However, due to the nature of USB-communication this will most likely not result in real-time behaviour.
